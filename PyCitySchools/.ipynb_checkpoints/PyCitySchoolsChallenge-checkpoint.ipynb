    "Charter Schools are the highest performing schools by percent of overall students passing math and reading. The 5 schools with the highest percentage of students were all Charter Schools. Conversely, District Schools were the lowest performing schools by percent of overall students passing math and reading. The 5 schools with the lowest percentage of passing students were all District Schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "This DataSet is interesting when comparing schools by size, average test score and overall percent of students passing. There are only 6 points of difference in the average math scores between small and medium schools verses large schools. Similarly, there are only 2 points of difference in the average reading scores between small and medium schools verses large schools. However, when we compare overall passing rates between schools by size, there is a disparate amount of students not passing in large schools vs medium/small schools (58% vs 90%). \n",
    "\n",
    "It appears that most of the large schools are District Schools, which are under-performing when compared to small/medium sized Charter Schools. What is causing the wide gap between students passing in District vs Charter and large vs small and medium schools when students as a whole are scoring similarly in subjects no matter the school size or type. Further data is needed to determine what other factors are impacting large schools. \n"
